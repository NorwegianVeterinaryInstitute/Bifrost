/*
* Profile for use on a slurm queueing system
* This file will have to be modified to your local system
* Currently this file assumes that a lot of software is available
* via the module system http://modules.sourceforge.net/
* If this is not the case, all software listed after "module"
* have to be given a specific path so that it will be available
*
* Currently this file is tuned to work on the Abel University
* of Oslo HPC cluster.
*
* Not all software is being used by all tracks. Each software
* contains a comment explaining which track(s) it is part of.
